# legal.download
This script downloads legal documents (e.g., decisions) from a web service for multiple process IDs. It fetches document lists, filters by type, and downloads files in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor. The script reads process IDs from an Excel file and saves downloaded files as .zip.
